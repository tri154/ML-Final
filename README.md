## Repository Contents

### 1. `From scratch.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook contains our implementation developed from scratch based on our original idea.
- **Origin:** Refactored from an earlier version available at [Kaggle: From Scratch Implementation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/quang0150/project?scriptVersionId=213203036).

### 2. `cmi-eda.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook provides an EDA of the time-series dataset used in the competition.
- **Reference:** The older version of this notebook mentioned in the report can be found at [Kaggle: CMI EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/qwerty197/cmi-eda).

### 3. `Improve from sample code.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook is a fork of the Kaggle notebook [CMI Tuning Ensemble of Solutions](https://www.kaggle.com/code/batprem/cmi-tuning-ensemble-of-solutions?scriptVersionId=212812994). 
  - We enhanced the solution by incorporating time-series features extracted during EDA.
  - **Results:** The updated solution achieved the results detailed in [Kaggle: Enhanced Solution](https://www.kaggle.com/code/quang0150/project?scriptVersionId=213924420).
